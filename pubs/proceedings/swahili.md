We discuss the open question of the relation between semantics and nominal
class assignment in Swahili. We approach the problem from a computational
perspective, aiming first to quantify the extent of this relation, and then to
explicate its nature, taking extra care to suppress morphosyntactic confounds.
Our results are the first of their kind, providing a quantitative evaluation of
the semantic cohesion of each nominal class, as well as a nuanced taxonomic
description of its semantic content.
