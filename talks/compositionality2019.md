Recent advances in distributional-compositional semantics propose the use
of vectorial word representations as a means of constructing meaning for larger
linguistic units. The spaces occupied by these representations and the manner
in which they combine are dictated by linear λ-terms which encode the sentence
semantics. Despite their crucial role in the composition process, the terms them-
selves are given little attention and are assumed to be known in advance. This
work will present a general framework for converting unprocessed text into a
Type-Logical syntactic derivation. The Curry-Howard correspondence between
proofs and programs identifies the derivation with a unique corresponding term,
which can then be used as a generic structural skeleton for any semantic inter-
pretation
