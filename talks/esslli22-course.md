We see how the unary operations of modal logic can happily coexist with the
multiplicative rules of intuitionistic linear logic, and how the two together
allow us to pratically model a variety of complex linguistic phenomena at the
syntax-semantics interface. We discuss the issues inherent to the natural
deduction presentation of the logic, and see how they dissipate if
one adopts Girard's proof nets instead. In the resulting framework, we break
proof search apart into a sequence of simple, intuitive steps, and translate
them to neural operations. Finally, we play around in real time with the
end-to-end model and seek out its strengths and weaknesses.
