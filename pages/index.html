Hey!

<p>
<div>I am Kokos [he/him]. I like to think, read, and talk about stuff at the intersection of formal logics, linguistics, and machine learning.

<h3>Whereabouts / Short CV</h3>
On my day to day, I am a post-doctoral researcher at Aalto University, where I do neurosymbolic reinforcement learning.
Exceptionally, on Mondays and Tuesdays, I do climate stuff with neural networks for <a href="https://www.skyfora.com/" target="_blank">Skyfora</a>.
Beginning in September 2024, I will be visiting in the University of Bologna for a few months.

<p>
Before moving to Helsinki, I was located in Utrecht. I received my PhD (CompLing) and my master's degree (AI) from Utrecht University.
While in Utrecht, I was also working as a machine learning engineer at <a href="https://geekbot.io" target="_blank">geekbot</a>.
Before all that, I received my diploma in Electrical & Computer Engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.
</p>

<p>
  A longer version of the above can be found at my <a href="/cv.pdf">CV</a>.
</p>

<h3>Thesis</h3>
My dissertation is titled <i>Dependency as Modality, Parsing as Permutation: A Neurosymbolic Perspective on Categorial Grammars</i>.
It advocates the use of modalities as dependency annotations in type-logical grammars, 
and explores the parsing-as-deduction paradigm from a contemporary neurosymbolic perspective.

<p>
  People thought it was good: it is one of the two recipients of the 2024 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._W._Beth_Dissertation_Prize">E. W. Beth Dissertation Prize</a>.
  You can find a faithful copy of the physical print <a href="https://github.com/konstantinosKokos/phd-thesis/blob/main/thesis.pdf">here</a>.
  If (for whatever reason) you're interested in an actual physical copy, feel free to send me a message.
</p>

<h3>Research</h3>
My published research revolves around structured machine learning, neurosymbolic reasoning, and type-driven approaches to syntactic parsing and semantic compositionality, among other things.
I am especially interested in the interface between formal and data-driven methods;
if that floats your <s>boat</s> rubber duck, you can have a look at my <a href="/publications.html">publications page</a>. My latest paper is $partial("templates/last-paper.html")$.

<h3>Recent & Upcoming Talks</h3>
Here's a list of my recent and upcoming talks (more <a href="/talks.html">here</a>):

<h3>Teaching</h3>
To my great displeasure, I am currently not teaching. Previously, I participated in various capacities in the following courses:
<ul>
  <li>Compositional Models of Vector-Based Semantics (ESSLLI 2022, <em>lecture</em>)</li>
  <li>Logic & Language (2020-2021, <em>main lecturer</em>)</li>
  <li>Logic & Language (2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2021-2022, <em>lectures & project supervision</em>)</li>
  <li>Machine Learning for Human Vision & Language (2019-2020, <em>tutorials</em>)</li>
  <li>Advanced Topics in Cognitive Modelling (2018-2019, <em>tutorials</em>)</li>
</ul>
