Hey!

<p>
<div>I am Kokos (he/him).</div>

<p>
  From July onwards I will have joined the group of Vikas Garg as a postdoctoral researcher in Aalto University.
  My research is to revolve around reinforcement learning and its applications on neurosymbolic systems.   
</p>
    
<p>
  I recently defended my thesis, officially joining the doctors' club.
  My dissertation, titled <i>Dependency as Modality, Parsing as Permutation: A Neurosymbolic Perspective on Categorial Grammars</i> presents a modal extension to type-logical grammars intended to capture dependency roles, 
  and investigates the parsing-as-deduction paradigm from the angle of a machine learning practitioner.
  You can find a faithful copy of the physical print <a href="https://github.com/konstantinosKokos/phd-thesis/blob/main/thesis.pdf">here</a>.
  During my PhD, I received a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from Utrecht University. 
  Prior to that, I was working as a machine learning engineer at <a href="https://geekbot.io" target="_blank">geekbot.io</a>.
  Even previously, I received my diploma in Electrical & Computer Enginering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.
</p>

<p>
My published research revolves around structured machine learning, neurosymbolic reasoning, and type-driven approaches to syntactic parsing and semantic compositionality, among others.
I am especially interested in the interface between formal and data-driven methods;
if that floats your <s>boat</s> rubber duck, you can have a look at my <a href="/publications.html">publications page</a>.

<h3>Teaching</h3>
<div>I am not currenly teaching. Previously, I taught the 2020 edition of the Logic & Language course in the AI Master's programme of Utrecht University.</div>
<div>Aside that, I assisted in various capacities with the following courses:</div>
<ul>
  <li>Compositional Models of Vector-Based Semantics (ESSLLI 2022, <em>lecture)</li>
  <li>Logic & Language (2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2021-2022, <em>lectures & project supervision</em>)</li>
  <li>Machine Learning for Human Vision & Language (2019-2020, <em>tutorials</em>)</li>
  <li>Advanced Topics in Cognitive Modelling (2018-2019, <em>tutorials</em>)</li>
</ul>
